# Flight_Searcher
A course project developed during CS 400.

The project was collaborated with: Wendell Cai, Haozhe Wu, Bill Zhu.

I was the algorithm engineer during this project and the main part I was responsible for was writing the graph data structure with Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between 2 airports (node) on the graph data structure.

All tests was completed in Junit unit test.

Use
```
make run
```

to run the program.

Please check all details in the makefile.

Programs can be run using both javafx-sdk-11 or javafx-sdk-18.
